# Release Notes - v1.1.0

## 🎉 Major Electron Application Fixes & Enhancements

This release focuses on **critical Electron application fixes** that resolve the main issues preventing the desktop app from functioning properly, plus comprehensive security and build improvements.

## 🔧 Critical Bug Fixes

### **Fixed: Blank Window Issue** ✅
- **Root Cause**: better-sqlite3 Node module version mismatch between system Node.js and Electron's embedded Node.js
- **Solution**: Added `electron-rebuild` step and automated native module rebuilding
- **Result**: Desktop application now displays content properly instead of blank window

### **Fixed: Application Not Closing Properly** ✅  
- **Root Cause**: Improper application lifecycle management with tray integration
- **Solution**: Enhanced quit detection logic and window close handlers
- **Result**: Application now terminates cleanly when closed, no more hanging processes

### **Fixed: Database Connection Failures** ✅
- **Root Cause**: SQLite native module compiled for wrong Node.js ABI version  
- **Solution**: Automated `npx electron-rebuild` process for native module compatibility
- **Result**: SQLite database initializes successfully with proper seeding

### **Fixed: Renderer Loading Path Issues** ✅
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect relative path calculation in production builds
- **Solution**: Updated renderer path from `../renderer/` to `../../../../renderer/` 
- **Result**: Proper file:// URL loading in production mode

## 🚀 New Features & Scripts

### **Production Electron Scripts**
- `npm run electron:start:prod` - Run built app in production mode
- `npm run electron:rebuild` - Rebuild native modules for Electron compatibility
- Enhanced build process with proper NODE_ENV handling

### **Comprehensive Testing Suite** 
- Added `windowManager.test.ts` - Window lifecycle testing
- Added `appLifecycle.test.ts` - Application startup/shutdown validation  
- Added `rendererLoading.test.ts` - Renderer process validation
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors in test files

## 🔒 Security & Performance Improvements

### **Dependency Updates (Phase 1)**
- Updated major dependencies: @astrojs/node, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, @types/node, astro, better-sqlite3, framer-motion, ts-jest
- Addressed security vulnerabilities in npm audit
- Improved dependency compatibility

### **Webpack Enhancements (Phase 2)**
- Increased performance limits to 1MB (appropriate for desktop apps)
- Added production source maps (`nosources-source-map`) for better debugging
- Enhanced bundle optimization and code splitting

### **Electron Security Hardening**
- Enhanced webPreferences with security flags

- Added `electron:rebuild` steps to handle native modules in CI/CD
- Fixed renderer path validation in release workflow
- Added multi-strategy native module rebuilding with fallbacks
- Enhanced build artifact validation and cross-platform compatibility

### **Testing Infrastructure**  
- All test files now compile without TypeScript errors
- Enhanced mock objects with proper type safety
- Improved error handling in test implementations

## 📈 Quality Improvements

### **Node.js Version Update**
- Updated requirement from `>=16.0.0` to `>=18.0.0`
- Better security and performance with latest LTS features

### **Build Process Optimization**
- Added bundle analysis script (`electron:analyze`)
- Improved build caching and cleaning utilities
- Enhanced webpack configuration for desktop applications
