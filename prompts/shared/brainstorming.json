Initial Idea Generation ({{technique}})**\nGenerate {{idea_count}} initial ideas using the {{technique}} technique:\n- Focus on quantity over quality initially\n- Build on previous ideas when possible\n- Think outside conventional boundaries\n- Consider different perspectives and stakeholders\n\n**2. Idea Categorization**\nGroup the ideas into logical categories:\n- High-impact, low-effort (quick wins)\n- High-impact, high-effort (major initiatives)\n- Low-impact, low-effort (nice-to-haves)\n- Wildcard ideas (unconventional approaches)\n\n**3. Idea Development**\nTake the {{top_count}} most promising ideas and develop them further:\n- Expand on the core concept\n- Address potential challenges\n- Identify required resources\n- Suggest next steps for validation\n\n**4. Creative Enhancement**\nApply creative thinking techniques to enhance the top ideas:\n- What if we combined multiple ideas?\n- How would different industries approach this?\n- What would the opposite solution look like?\n- How could emerging technologies help?\n\n**5. Practical Evaluation**\nEvaluate ideas against practical criteria:\n- Feasibility (1-10 scale)\n- Potential impact (1-10 scale)\n- Resource requirements\n- Risk factors\n- Timeline considerations\n\nPlease maintain an optimistic, creative mindset while also providing realistic assessments.",
